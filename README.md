This code implements a memoizing binary search tree (BST) data structure. The BST maintains a sorted order based on the keys of its nodes. It allows insertion of key-value pairs and provides a query function to find the maximum value within a specified range. The memoizing aspect optimizes the query operation by storing the maximum value within each subtree. When a query is made, the code efficiently traverses the tree and returns the maximum value within the given range. In this specific example, the code creates a BST of incomes associated with ages, and it allows the user to input a range of ages to find the maximum income within that range.
